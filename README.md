# Project-1

# Key Objectives

This analysis aims to explore the following questions:

How have median house prices and related variables changed over time across the USA?

How do selected demographic variables correlate with median house prices across counties?

Are median house prices higher in counties with a more educated population?

What is the distribution of housing prices in high-poverty vs. low-poverty areas?

How do median house prices and poverty rates compare across urban and rural areas in the USA?


#Conclusion

The analysis underscores the complex relationships between median house prices, household income, employment rates, education levels, and poverty rates:

Income is the strongest predictor of house prices, with wealthier areas sustaining higher market values.

Employment has a modest influence on house prices, with other factors like tourism, investment, and urban demand playing significant roles in specific regions.

Education moderately impacts house prices, with better-educated populations generally associated with higher property values.

Poverty is inversely related to house prices, with urban areas showing stronger economic resilience compared to rural regions.

Affordability remains a pressing issue, as house price growth continues to outpace income and employment growth.

This analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers, real estate professionals, and researchers. Future strategies should focus on promoting affordable housing, reducing economic disparities, and addressing the challenges faced by high-poverty and rural areas.
